PROJECT DESCRIPTION: At the end of my first programming course, students were 
given the opportunity to utilize all of the knowledge and skills acquired in 
the class to build a project of their own. This is a simple tic tac toe game 
that alternates an 'x' 'o' input based on the users location choice.
